## Flow

Flow control language frontend, compiler backend, and virtual machine.

here be dragons (with ponnies)

### Goal

- enable other projects to use Flow as their own flow control configuration language.
- in theory, be able to add other language frontends that can make use of the backend & VM.

### Components

- language frontend
- compiler backend (IR & target code generator)
- virtual machine
